        <p>
            While making websites, <i>you will find yourself frequently resizing your browser window</i>, dragging from the sides and the corners to test and visualize how the site looks at <b>different</b> screen or window sizes. Most websites don't consider this behavior a useful way of engaging with a website, and most users won't think to see what happens when the window is resized -- but that doesn't mean we can't experiment with it (and maybe we can even change some minds...).

        <p class="special">
            <i>Create a website</i> that uses media queries to construct a narrative across different screen sizes (or a browser that is being operated like an accordion).
